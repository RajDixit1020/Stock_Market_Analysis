# Stock_Market_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing stock market data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to explore historical stock price movements, perform data cleaning, apply statistical techniques, and generate visual insights that can help in understanding market behavior.
The analysis covers several essential aspects of financial data exploration:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, normalization, and time-series formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, comparing multiple stocks, calculating moving averages, and volatility measures.

Statistical Insights: Correlation between different stock prices, daily returns, cumulative returns, and risk analysis.

Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create candlestick plots, trendlines, distribution charts, and heatmaps for clearer understanding.

SQL Integration: Demonstrating how to query stock market datasets efficiently, store results, and connect structured analysis with Python workflows.
This repository is designed not only as a project but also as a learning resource for beginners in Data Analytics and Financial Analysis. It provides a structured path to apply data science skills to a real-world domain, the stock market, where decision-making relies heavily on quantitative insights.

Key features of this project include:
